# Introduction to Electroencephalography (EEG)
Electroencephalography, or EEG, is a technique used to measure the electrical activity of the brain.

---

# How EEG Works
EEG uses electrodes placed on the scalp to detect the electrical activity of neurons in the cerebral cortex. It records signals from small areas of the brain around each electrode, mostly measuring postsynaptic potentials.

---

# EEG Results
EEG provides an image of electrical activity in the brain represented as waves of varying frequency, amplitude, and shape. It can be used to measure brain activity during an event, i.e., event-related potential, or spontaneous activity.

---

# Clinical Applications of EEG
EEG is commonly used to diagnose epilepsy, sleep disorders and provide information about other types of brain dysfunction. 

---

# Limitations of EEG
EEG is difficult to pinpoint activity in a precise location and is limited in its ability to accurately record activity in deeper brain structures. 

---

# Conclusion
EEG is a beneficial technique for measuring brain activity and has clinical applications. Despite its limitations, it provides a low-cost alternative that measures brain activity on the order of milliseconds.
